# calculator
Calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The purpose of this project was to practice the basics of the above languages by building a fully functioning calculator that lets users perform basic operations.

This calculator includes the following features:
- Handle basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and divition)
- Allow chaining operations. Ex: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 will equal 42, but when you press "-", it'll show the result of 12 + 7, which is 19. And the you press "*", it will show 12 (19-5) and so on
- Clear the display and stored values with the "AC" button
- You can use the keyboard to operate the calculator
- Use decimal points in your inputs, but the decimal point button gets disabled when there's already one in the display
- The calculator numbers are limited to 10 digits, so they won't overflow out of the display
- Has a backspace button that lets users erase the last digit they typed
- It displays a snarky error message when the user tries to divide by 0, and clears the calculator
